[NAME=Mushi][SPEAKERSPRITE=Mushi]Elder! Elder! The curse is spreading more!
[NAME=Elder][SPEAKERSPRITE=Elder NPC]Mushi, you are finally here. I must tell you something.
[NAME=Mushi][SPEAKERSPRITE=Mushi]What is it Elder?
[NAME=Elder][SPEAKERSPRITE=Elder NPC]You have the power to quell the Godfell's Regret.
[NAME=Elder][SPEAKERSPRITE=Elder NPC]Cleanse it with your magic and the curses will lift.
[NAME=Elder][SPEAKERSPRITE=Elder NPC]Along the way, make sure to collect the seeds of life, like the one behind me.
[NAME=Elder][SPEAKERSPRITE=Elder NPC]Once the curse is gone, we can recover the forest with it.
[NAME=Mushi][SPEAKERSPRITE=Mushi]Okay Elder, leave it to me!
